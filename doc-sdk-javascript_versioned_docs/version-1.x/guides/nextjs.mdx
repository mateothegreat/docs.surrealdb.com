# Next.js

Nextjs is a popular React framework that allows you to build static and server-rendered web applications. The SurrealDB SDK for Next.js enables simple and advanced querying of a remote database from a Next.js application. All connections to SurrealDB are made over WebSockets, and automatically reconnect when the connection is terminated.

In this guide, you will learn how to integrate SurrealDB with a Next.js application and perform basic data queries. The guide will cover the following topics:

- Setting up a Next.js application with Pages or API routes
- Using SurrealDB methods to perform data queries
- Displaying data in a Next.js application
